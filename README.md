# SMASaveSystem

SMASaveSystem is a simple wrapper for saving objects on Mac OS X and iOS.

This was originally inspired by [ABSaveSystem](https://github.com/alexblunck/ABSaveSystem) which hasn't been updated in quite a while. We use this quite a bit so we decided to modernize it for Swift so we can continue using it going forward.
